# Social Queue

Social Queue is an open-source Notion-based social media scheduling tool.

It allows you to create, plan, and schedule your social media posts all within Notion. It's essentialy [buffer]([url](https://buffer.com/)) that uses Notion for the post creation/scheduling.

When you authenticate with Social Queue, we provide you with the Notion template to duplicate into your account, and then we read that duplicated template to find any new posts to schedule.

Full instructions on how to set up Social Queue [url](https://luxurious-flat-431.notion.site/How-to-set-up-SocialQueue-5da1f877dcdc4840b4737c3df44a75e4).

We are built on top of [Vercel](https://youraveragetechbro.canny.io/social-queue)), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)), and [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)).
